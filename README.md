# Blackjack

A web app in PHP and JavaScript.

Intended use at the time of creation was to practice counting cards,
so basic strategy and a hidden Hi-Lo counter is at your disposal.

Click on the dealer's deck to toggle on/off for the Hi-Lo counter.

## To run in a local environment

If you have PHP installed (try "php -v" on command line), you can use the built-in
web server to play:

    $ cd blackjack/
    $ php -S localhost:8080

Now point your browser to *http://localhost:8080/* and try to beat the dealer!

## Why do you use PHP?

It was made years ago and at the time I didn't know enough JS (and jQuery etc wasn't
really what it is today), so I made some parts in PHP and the rest in JS.

Could be a nice project to rewrite the entire thing with modern solutions!
