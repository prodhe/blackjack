# Blackjack

A web app in PHP and JavaScript. Intended use at the time of creation was to practice
counting cards, so basic strategy and a hidden Hi-Lo counter is at your disposal.

Click on the dealer's deck to toggle on/off for the Hi-Lo counter.

## To run in a local environment

If you have PHP installed (try "php -v" on command line), you can use the built-in
web server to play:

    $ cd blackjack/
    $ php -S localhost:8080

Now point your browser to *http://localhost:8080/* and try to beat the dealer!
